==========

github actions:

- install for E+ worked for
    - E+ version 22.2
    - Ubuntu-20.04
- install for E+ failed for
    - E+ version 22.2
    - Ubuntu-22.04

both ./github/workflows/main.yml and ./github/workflows/install.sh have to be updated to reflect the above two installs.

    
Next step
---------

- have a setup file where version number can be set.
- hard todo -
    - two files have to be updated
    - might have to do by hand.
    - local testing may have to be done from a different place.
